## Key Features

- Enterprise-class application server built on [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) and [Redis](https://redislabs.com/) that meets infinitely scalable demands.
- Multi-core / Multi-threaded application host operations remove the burden of such considerations from the application developer.
- Out of the box webpacking with sane defaults.  Don't worry you can override and/or add to them whenever you want :)
- A unique and easy to use component-based model that is flexible with popular frameworks such as Angular, Vue.js, ReactJS, X-Tag, SkateJS, Ember, and much more.
- Supports multiple view engines such as Pug/Jade, Handlebars, EJS and HTML5.

## Installation

The latest stable release of Avian is available on [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@flypapertech/avian).

    npm install @flypapertech/avian

    or

    yarn add @flypapertech/avian

### System Requirements

#### NodeJS

Avian requires NodeJS version 8.0 and above.

#### Redis Server

Avian uses Redis Server for storing session data, caching component config object requests and arbitrary caching requirements you may have.  Avian does not support password protected Redis Servers at this time.

Suggested Redis Installation Methods

- macOS
  - `brew install redis`
- Linux
  - [Debian Installation Instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-redis-on-ubuntu-18-04)
    - Note: You can use other flavors of Linux. We just aren't familiar with the installation of Redis on them.
- Windows
  - [Windows with WSL (10 and higher)](https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-on-windows-10/)
  - [Windows without WSL (8.1 and lower)](https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-on-windows-8-1-and-previous-versions/)
    - Note: It is not recommended to use Redis in production on Windows with out WSL.

## Getting Started

After Avian is installed as a dependency of your application start Avian via:

    node ./node_modules/.bin/avian

### CLI Arguments

- --home (directory of your application, defaults to current working directory)
- --port (port to start express server, defaults to 8080)
- --mode (mode to run Avian in, development or production, defaults to development)
- --redisPort (port that your Redis server is listening on, defaults to 6379)
- --redisHost (host where your Redis server is running, defaults to 127.0.0.1)
- --redisSessionDB (the Redis database number to store session data, defaults to 1)
- --redisCacheDB (the Redis database number to store general cache data, defaults to 2)
- --webpack (directory to find webpack config files to override Avian default, defaults to home)

### Session Management

Avian uses [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session) to manage client sessions. All sessions are stored in a Redis database.

- Browser Based Clients
  - Avian uses secure [HttpOnly Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies) for managing browser based client sessions.

- Mobile Device and API Clients
  - Avian augments express-session to allow API and mobile device sessions management.  Since those clients may not use coookies they simply need to send their session ID in the authorization header of all requests made to Avian. See below for an example header.

```json
headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer Session_ID"
}
```

### Global Variables Added by Avian

#### Properties Added to All Request Objects

`req.argv` contains a copy of all arguments passed to Avian at start time.

`req.cache` is a RedisClient instance hooked to Avian's config object cache. Feel free to use it for your own needs as well.

`req.params` paramaters passed to your component. Typically this is used to determine the component name being rendered, e.g. req.params.component.

`req.query` contains all query parameters passed to the componenent being requested.

#### Developing w/ TypeScript

To make TypeScript aware of the globals Avian adds to your application simply place the below import into any .d.ts file that is within your application.

```typescript
import * as Avian from "@flypapertech/avian"
```
