# Avian
Create Enterprise-class component driven applications that scale.

## Key Features
- Enterprise-class application server built on [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) that meets infinitely scalable demands.
- A unique and easy to use component-based model that is flexible with popular
frameworks such as Angular, Vue.js, ReactJS, X-Tag, SkateJS, Ember, and much more.
- Multi-core / Multi-threaded application host operations remove the burden of such considerations from the application developer.
- Out of the box webpacking with sane defaults.  Don't worry you can override and/or add to them whenever you want :)

# Installation
The latest stable release of Avian is available via the Node Package Manager.

```
npm install @flypapertech/avian

or

yarn add @flypapertech/avian

    - Redis Server
    - GCC 4.8+ / G++5 / Python 2.x
- Windows
    - Redis Server
    - Visual Studio, Windows SDK, .NET and Python 2.x.

- --home (directory of your application, defaults to .)
- --port (port to start express server, defaults to 8080)
- --mode (mode to run avian in, development or production, defaults to development)
- --redisPort (port that your Redis server is listening on, defaults to 6379)
- --redisHost (host where your Redis server is running, defaults to 127.0.0.1)

## Express Globals Added by Avian
### Properties Added to All Request Objects
`req.argv` contains a copy of all arguments passed to avian at start

`req.cache` is a RedisClient instance hooked to avian's config object cache. Feel free to use it for your own needs as well.

### Using Typescript?
To make typescript aware of the globals Avian adds to your project simply place the below import into any .d.ts file that is within your project
```typescript
import * as Avian from "@flypapertech/avian"
```
