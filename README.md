# Avian
Create Enterprise-class component driven applications that scale.

## Key Features
- Enterprise-class application server built on [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) that meets infinitely scalable demands.
- A unique and easy to use component-based model that is flexible with popular
frameworks such as Angular, Vue.js, ReactJS, X-Tag, SkateJS, Ember, and much more.
- Multi-core / Multi-threaded application host operations remove the burden of such considerations from the application developer.
- Out of the box webpacking with sane defaults.  Don't worry you can override and/or add to them whenever you want :)

# Installation
The latest stable release of Avian is available via the Node Package Manager.

```
npm install @flypapertech/avian

or

yarn add @flypapertech/avian
```

## System Requirements
### NodeJS
Avian requires NodeJS version >9.0

### Redis Server
Avian uses Redis Server for storing session data, caching component config object requests and arbitrary caching requirements you may have.  Avian does not support password protected Redis Servers at this time.

Suggested Redis Installation Methods
- macOS
    - `brew install redis`
- Linux
    - [Debian Installation Instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-redis-on-ubuntu-18-04)
    - You can use other flavors of Linux, we just aren't familiar with the installation of Redis on them.
- Windows
    - [Windows with WSL (10 and higher)](https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-on-windows-10/)
    - [Windows without WSL (8.1 and lower)](https://redislabs.com/blog/redis-on-windows-8-1-and-previous-versions/)
        - Note: it is not recommended to use Redis in production on Windows with out WSL.

## Understanding Session Management
Avian uses [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session) to manage client sessions. All sessions are stored in a Redis database.

- Browser Based Clients
    - Avian uses secure [HttpOnly Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies) for managing browser based client sessions.

- Mobile Device and API Clients
    - Avian augments express-session to allow API and mobile device sessions management.  Since those clients may not use coookies they simply need to send their session ID in the authorization header of all requests made to Avian. See below for an example header.

```json
headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer Session_ID"
}
```

## Global Variables Added by Avian
### Properties Added to All Request Objects
`req.argv` contains a copy of all arguments passed to avian at start

`req.cache` is a RedisClient instance hooked to avian's config object cache. Feel free to use it for your own needs as well.

### Using TypeScript?
To make TypeScript aware of the globals Avian adds to your application simply place the below import into any .d.ts file that is within your application.
```typescript
import * as Avian from "@flypapertech/avian"
```
